You are a research assistant. Search the web for the following query.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Write findings to /tmp/onchain-alpha.md INCREMENTALLY — after EACH search, append what you found immediately. Do NOT wait until the end.
2. Start the file with a title and query, then append sections as you discover them.
3. Keep searches focused — max 8 web searches. Synthesize what you have, don't over-research.
4. Include source URLs inline.
5. End with a brief summary section.

Query: Find any NEW on-chain meme tokens in last 30 minutes with strong momentum. Require at least two signals among volume/txn spike, holder/wallet growth, liquidity inflow, multi-platform mention (DexScreener+GMGN+X), smart money tracking. Return token name, symbol, chain, contract address, evidence links. Focus SOL/ETH/Base.

Start by writing the file header NOW, then search and append.

**Planning parallel file reads**
codex
I’m going to initialize session context first per your workspace rules (`SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, and recent memory files), then I’ll create `/tmp/onchain-alpha.md` with the header and start appending findings after each search result.

**Exploring sandbox workarounds**
codex
I hit a sandbox execution failure for terminal commands, so I’m switching to direct file editing to create `/tmp/onchain-alpha.md` and continue the research workflow incrementally.
